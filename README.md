# VS Code Keyboard Navigation

The VS Code Keyboard Navigation extension provides an opinionated modal keyboard grammar that focuses on speedrunning the Workbench UI.
It is designed to build upon and complement vi/vim/neovim muscle memory by including alt+hjkl alongside alt+arrow key navigation throughout
the VS Code WorkBench UI components (editor groups, side bars, panel, and terminals).

This git repository contains the user-facing extension plus supporting scripts, development notes, and examples for contributors and advanced users.
If we build it well then it won't change often.
